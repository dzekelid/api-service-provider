description: API World 2014 is the largest API conference + expo thats 100% dedicated
  to developers. That means developers can come explore dozens of APIs that can augment,
  analyze, or monetize their apps. We also offer talks about developing APIs so your
  technology can be part of a larger app ecosystem. Our goal is to place API World
  at the center of the emerging API Economy. Just as the world wide web is an open
  network of information that the end user can search and consume, the API Economy
  is an open network of data, services, and activities that connect technology to
  other technology. Just as the web makes information connected, APIs make technology
  connected.
